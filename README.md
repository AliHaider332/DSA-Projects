# 🎯 Simple Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple console-based calculator program written in C++. It takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Supports four arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
✅ Handles division by zero with a prompt for a valid divisor  
✅ Uses a `switch` statement for operation selection  
✅ Provides a user-friendly interface for input and output  

## 📂 How to Run
```sh
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```

# 📌 Process Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This program simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms to manage processes. It provides options for **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**, **Priority Scheduling**, **Short Job First (SJF)**, and **Round Robin (RR)** scheduling.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Implements FCFS, Priority Scheduling, SJF, and Round Robin  
✅ Displays process states (**New**, **Ready**, **Running**, **Waiting**, and **Terminated**)  
✅ Handles interrupts and process transitions  
✅ Allows user input for process details  

## 📂 How to Run
```sh
g++ scheduler.cpp -o scheduler
./scheduler
```

# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (C++)

## Overview
This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** written in C++ where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between **1 and 100**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Generates a number between **1 and 100**  
✅ Provides hints (**Too High!** or **Too Low!**)  
✅ Counts the number of attempts  
✅ Allows the user to quit by entering **0**  

## 📂 How to Run
```sh
g++ number_guessing.cpp -o number_guessing
./number_guessing
```

# 📌 File Sorter & Renamer (C++)

## Overview
This is a **C++ program** that organizes files in a folder by sorting and renaming them in a sequential order. It also provides an **undo feature** to restore the original filenames.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Sorts files and renames them in numerical order  
✅ Provides undo functionality to restore original filenames  
✅ Handles invalid folders and prevents renaming failures  

## 📂 How to Run
```sh
g++ file_sorter.cpp -o file_sorter
./file_sorter
```

# 📌 Task Manager (C++)

## Overview
This is a simple C++ program that allows users to create, view, and delete tasks. It stores tasks in a text file (`ABC.txt`) and provides a menu-driven interface for task management.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Add, view, and delete tasks  
✅ Saves tasks persistently in `ABC.txt`  
✅ User-friendly menu-driven interface  

## 📂 How to Run
```sh
